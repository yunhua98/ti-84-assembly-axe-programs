Introduction/Summary
-----------------------
You are trapped in a series of dungeons filled with heavy boxes, holes, caged doors, and buttons.
You must escape by pushing blocks out of the way, cleverly pressing the right button to open the doors
In this brain twisting puzzle game created with the Axe Parser Language for the 2011 Omnimaga Contest #1.
This 83+/84+/SE game is feels old-school and classic, but is filled with more interesting twists.


Installation
-----------------------
Since this program is created with Axe Parser (http://axe.omnimaga.org, version of Axe this was compiled with is included as the .8xk file), its source code can be compiled for a shell
or nostub.  Since the source code is not public YET (as per rules of contest), I have provided a nostub version of the game, run with Asm(.
To install the program, simply send ESCAPE.8xp to your calculator and play it with [2nd]>[0]>Asm( and then the program name.



Instructions
-----------------------
Press the arrow keys to go the corresponding directions, and the object is to get to the opening in the lower right-hand corner.
Press Mode to restart the level and + to skip to the next level.  Clear to exit.

Below is a description of all the tiles.

Box:
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€        ¨€¨€
¨€  ¨€    ¨€  ¨€
¨€    ¨€¨€    ¨€
¨€    ¨€¨€    ¨€
¨€  ¨€    ¨€  ¨€
¨€¨€        ¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
You can push these around, into holes, and generally just get them out of your way.

Button:

    ¨€¨€¨€¨€    
  ¨€        ¨€  
¨€            ¨€
¨€¨€        ¨€¨€
¨€  ¨€¨€¨€¨€  ¨€
  ¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€

Stepping on these will toggle the doors between opening and closing.

Door:
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€    ¨€¨€    ¨€
¨€    ¨€¨€    ¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€    ¨€¨€    ¨€
¨€    ¨€¨€    ¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
Pressing the buttons will lift the doors up.

Hole:
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€¨€
These holes are the exact dimensions of the box.  They fit snugly.
