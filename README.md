# ti-84-programs
Old programs written for TI-84+ calculators, mostly in a 3rd party compiled language called Axe. Recently realized that they were still hosted online, so I downloaded them all and compiled them into one place in case they get lost. Sentimental value and all that.

I included the files and documentation for Axe Parser as well; it's a great tool that made all this stuff possible.
